          I've been drawn to functional programming for more than a decade.
          Nowadays I'm mainly working with front end technologies,
          like React & Elm. I'm writing

          I have built a couple of startups that were very seminal in Brazil's
          social entrepreneurship scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked with and helped build Rails' community since '05, when I
          started my own consultancy that lasted till '09.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been an agile advocate since '03, teached and coached dozens of
          developers and managed several teams delivering high value results.

          If I had to build a developers dream team, Juan would probably be one
          of them. He's a very smart and nice guy and he is very comfortable to
          work with. He likes to help and you can learn a lot working with him.
          I hope our paths will cross again in the future.

            Maiz is the kind of person who does not fit this squared recommendation
            field. Maiz is where wisdom, purpose and technical mastery meet.
            This is so rare and unusual that it becomes impossible to describe
            how thankful I am for all the moments we have spent together.
            <br /><br />
            If you really have the courage to interact with someone who deeply
            knows what ethics mean and who will surely do things better than
            you will ever judge as possible, you may be prepared to work with
            him.

          An excellent tool. If you're a designer, study it to learn how to create an attractive
          experience. If you're a product developer, look how they have created a
          complete, well documented package with a great finish.
          A great reference for any SaaS product.

          ... a consistent interface, cool features and many other positive
          aspects. It may seem funny that an email marketing startup is among
          year's top, but believe me, they really have a level of quality no
          other company in this market can offer around here.
